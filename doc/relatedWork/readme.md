* Jonathan Corbet July 31, 2007 [Controlling memory use in containers](http://lwn.net/Articles/243795/) : There is, thus, a significant cost associated with the memory controller - the addition of five pointers (one in struct page, four in struct meta_page) and one atomic_t for every active page in the system can only hurt.

* [IBM AIX 6.1](http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/wiki/pub/Tec/ArtLehreSystemverwaltung2010/WPAR-sg247431.pdf): A WPAR (workload partition) is a software-created, virtualized OS environment within a single AIX V6
image. Each workload partition is a secure and isolated environment for the
application it hosts. The application in a WPAR thinks that it is being executed in
its own dedicated AIX instance.
