* Jonathan Corbet July 31, 2007 [Controlling memory use in containers](http://lwn.net/Articles/243795/) : There is, thus, a significant cost associated with the memory controller - the addition of five pointers (one in struct page, four in struct meta_page) and one atomic_t for every active page in the system can only hurt.

* Johannes Weiner Nov 11, 2011 [mm: memcg: remove optimization of keeping the root_mem_cgroup LRU lists empty](https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/11/8/414): The global per-zone LRU lists are about to go away on memcg-enabled kernels, with all pages being exclusively linked to their respective per-memcg LRU lists.
